NovelWriter is a web-based novel writing app with AI-powered analysis tools built directly into the writing experience.

It combines a full writing environment (chapters, scenes, characters, plot planning) with intelligent systems that read your manuscript and help you understand your story as you write it.

## What It Can Do

As you write, NovelWriter can automatically:

- Plan and refine your story using the Novel **Agent panel** (4 modes)
- Build a visual **Event Line** of your story
- Detect **open plot lines** and possible plot holes
- Create a **Connection Web** between characters, places, and plot points
- Graph pacing, tension, atmosphere, and depth (**Story Pulse**)
- Gives you detailed **Agent analysis** of parts of your manuscript.
- Use **Novel Agent tools** to refine specific scenes through inline suggestions.
- Generate **summaries** and **world information**
- Simulate reader reactions in the **Echo Chamber** (optional)
- Show **live mood** and **remarks** while you type (optional)

All of this works directly from your manuscript.
